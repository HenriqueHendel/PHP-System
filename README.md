# PHP-System
This is a system build with PHP to register customers data in a database. In this example, the system is to register billing data of snacks bar, cafe, small restaurants and etc.

## About This Project
It is a simple system, where the cashier can register customers billings.

The table of the index and expenses page were already on the front-end template. I just automated it to show the values deal with the data in the database.

This project is a part of my personal portfilio and my objective is improve my code skills and knowledge every day. So, if you could provide me any feedback, I will be very happy :)

## How To Use This System

### Index Page 
- In the index page, you can see informations about your company, as how many customers you have attended, the cash-flow, the expenses and the profit on the colorful cards. On the table, you can see the billing of all your customers, in addition to anything you want to register about him.

### Order Page
- In the order page, you can put your menu and select the food and drinks according the customer order. After that, you select the shipping rate, if to delivery, and any discount, if you want. To finish, you click on the button "Calculate Order" to generate a text that describe all billing of your customer, calculating automatically the values. If you want, you can send this text to your customer, if the the order is online. You can too delete the order, if something is wrong. If everthing is good, you can confirm the order by click on the button "Confirm Order", selecting how much the customer paid (to calculate the change and save the values) and how he paid.
